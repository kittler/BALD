The BRAAFF-Annotated Acral Lesions Dataset (BALD): A curated set of dermatoscopic images of acral melanoma and nevi from various sources

Our dataset includes 666 dermatoscopic images of acral lesions from seven academic centers in Austria, Greece, France, Italy, and Japan, featuring 144 melanomas and 522 nevi. Images are provided by the International Dermoscopy Society and come from the original BRAAFF dataset (Lallas A, Kyrgidis A, Koga H, et al. The BRAAFF checklist: a new dermoscopic algorithm for diagnosing acral melanoma. Br J Dermatol. 2015;173(4):1041-1049. doi:10.1111/bjd.1404) and a validation set (Müller C, Kittler H, Tschandl P, et al. Validation of a Dermatoscopy-Based Algorithm for the Diagnosis of Acral Melanoma. Dermatology. Published online October 5, 2024. doi:10.1159/000541591 ). 

All 666 images are of lesions on glabrous skin (mostly soles).  Patients were European or Asian, with a mean age of 43 years (SD: 22); 61.1% were female. All melanomas were excised and examined histopathologically; 33.3% were in situ, with a median invasion depth of 1.65 mm. Of the nevi, 193 were excised, and the rest showed typical morphology or were monitored.

Annotations were collected through an online reader study designed to reevaluate the BRAAFF checklist for diagnosing acral melanoma. This annotated dataset is intended to serve as a benchmark for differentiating acral melanoma from nevi supporting training and validation of machine learning models. The dataset is available on the ISIC archive with basic metadata, while extended annotations are provided here. The dataset is distributed under a CC-BY-NC license for research and teaching with citation required.
