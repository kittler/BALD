The BRAAFF-Annotated Acral Lesions Dataset (BALD): A curated set of dermatoscopic images of acral melanoma and nevi from various sources

Our dataset includes 666 dermatoscopic images of acral lesions from seven academic centers in Austria, Greece, France, Italy, and Japan, featuring 144 melanomas and 522 nevi. Images came from the original BRAAFF dataset (603 lesions) and a validation set (74 lesions). All images are of lesions on glabrous skin (mostly soles, n=544). Patients were European or Asian, with a mean age of 43 years (SD: 22); 61.1% were female. All melanomas were excised and examined histopathologically; 33.3% were in situ, with a median invasion depth of 1.65 mm. Of the nevi, 193 were excised, and the rest showed typical morphology or were monitored.

This annotated dataset serves as a benchmark for differentiating acral melanoma from nevi and supports training and validation of machine learning models. It is available on the ISIC archive with basic metadata, while extended annotations are provided here. The dataset is distributed under a CC-BY-NC license for research and teaching, with required citation.
